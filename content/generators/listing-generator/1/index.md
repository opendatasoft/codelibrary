Try it! Click on "Edit on CodePen" to browse the code and see the config. You only need to edit from line 9 to 27 to try it on your own data!
For instance :

- On line 18, add `{'id':'remarques','multiple':true}` block to the list to add another filter component.
  `filters = ['technique','collection','genre','remarques'];`
- On line 27, change cards to table to change the listing mode !
  `view = 'table';`
- Discover all others settings in the documentation in the HTML code.
