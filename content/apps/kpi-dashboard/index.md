The city of Paris has built a dashboard of performance indicators using its website’s visual identity. Open to the public, the dashboard is designed around three axes, each represented by a color to facilitate sorting and readability: living together better (pink), the city that benefits everyone (blue) and the construction of tomorrow’s world (green). The municipality has chosen to represent a percentage rate of completion of its service’s actions, accompanied with a progress bar. Each action is contextualized by a page mixing texts, and data visualizations. This page also gives access to the data set’s source used to build the performance indicators.
