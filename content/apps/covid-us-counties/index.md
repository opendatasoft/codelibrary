## Description

**The context**

You want to keep the population updated on the number of cases, the number of occupied hospital beds etc. in their surroundings. You want to make the data available for nation-wide aggregation.

This page aggregates a number of indicators, with key figures, maps, tables etc. that allows to share detailed data with a simple visualization. All the aggregated data by day, by zipcode, by gender etc. are pre-configured.
