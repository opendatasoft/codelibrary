Create an age pyramid to present the repartition of the population in your area, with Vega-Lite.

**Vega-Lite** is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise, declarative JSON syntax to create an expressive range of visualizations for data analysis and presentation.

[ods-vega-lite-chart](https://help.opendatasoft.com/widgets/#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsVegaLiteChart) widget, in combinaison with `ods-adv-analysis` to get the data, allows adding Vega-Lite charts into your pages.
