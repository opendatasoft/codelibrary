## Months over several years range selector
Most complex scenario as the selector will keep an iterator to see witch value is selected, and compute the date each time another selection is made. It's based on this iterator by starting from the starting date and increasing the number of months by this iterator to get back to the selection. It manipulates facets, dates, and advanced angularJs expression.
