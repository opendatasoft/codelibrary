Sometimes, the Y legend will need more than 1 column in the grid to display correctly.
The `yLegendWidth = 2` option in this example set 2 column width for Y legend values.

The X legend can be centered, and a slight rotation can give some space and visibility. 
Two CSS classes are proposed to achieve this : `x-axis-centered` and `x-axis-rotate` to set on the X axis loop (HTML side).
