`display-values=true` option displays for each point of a chart the values of the series. 
It's usefull but can quickly overload the chart and displaying only a view values can be interesting. 

This code presents some CSS tricks to cherry-pick only a few values :
- On the left, only the first and last values
- On the right, 1 out of 3 values are displayed (see the CSS code for explanations)
