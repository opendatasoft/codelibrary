In this example, `refineOnClick` will be used to display record details on the side of the map. It's a good alternative to the pop-in version.

> To  highlight the selected point on the map, the refined context is displayed. To achieve this, the context must be refined by a field that contains an unique name or ID, and therefore this field must be set has a filter/facet on the dataset.
