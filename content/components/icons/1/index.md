**Install guide:**

- Copy the CSS into your portal theme (in `backoffice -> look & feel -> theme -> stylesheet`, en Français : `Backoffice -> Apparence -> Thème -> Feuille de style`)
- Make live (save and apply your theme)
- Finally, simply use icons into your pages

**Usage:**

In your HTML, on `i` tag, set the class to `ri-` followed by the name of the icon.
For example, for the `alarm-fill` and `alarm-line` icons, try:
- `<i class="ri-alarm-fill"></i>`
- `<i class="ri-alarm-line" style="font-size: 2rem; color: cornflowerblue;"></i>`
