You can use multiple color theme on the same page by adding classes that redefines the same color variables as in `:root` (` --primary-hue, --primary-saturation` etc.)
. In this example, we add the following css class: `is-info`, `is-warning`, `is-success`. Then we apply them on `<section class="row is-XXX">â€¦</section>` to give specific colors to sections.
