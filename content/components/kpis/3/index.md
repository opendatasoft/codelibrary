Use `ods-adv-analysis` widget working with ODS Explore API V2 to display advanced calculations on your pages.
In the `select` parameter, you can enter an advanced query to make, following the [ODSQL select clause](https://help.opendatasoft.com/apis/ods-explore-v2/#section/Opendatasoft-Query-Language-(ODSQL)/Select-clause).

For more information about how to compute metrics and use the other parameters of `ods-adv-analysis`, see [ods-adv-analysis documentation](https://help.opendatasoft.com/widgets/#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsAdvAnalysis).

In the exemple, on the first row, we display the percentage of positive tests of Covid-19 in Auvergne-Rh√¥ne-Alpes; and on the second row, we display simple aggregations all made in one request through  `ods-adv-analysis`.
