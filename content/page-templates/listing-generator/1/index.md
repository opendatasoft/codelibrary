## Automated listing visualization

Edit only a few settings to generate a modern looking visulization that uses ODS components and widgets.
[See a live editing demo of this template on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huK1bNGjpkE) 

Try it! Click on "Edit on CodePen" to browse the code and see the config. You only need to edit from line 9 to 27 to try it on your own data! 
For instance :
- On line 18, add `{'id':'remarques','multiple':true}` block to the list to add another filter component.
`filters = ['technique','collection','genre','remarques'];`
- On line 27, change cards to table to change the listing mode !
`view = 'table';`
- Discover all others settings in the documentation in the HTML code
