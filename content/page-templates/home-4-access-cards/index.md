This home page integrates the first version of the [component Access cards](https://codelibrary.opendatasoft.com/components/access-card/) to highlight redirections to other pages.
The access cards are inserted in a grid container, so that all the cards have the same height.

**Tips**
- You can use another version of the access cards by replacing the HTML between the comments `<!--Start Access Card -->` and `<!--End Access Card -->` and the CSS between `/*==== Access Cards ====*/` and `/*==== Homepage Styles ====*/`
- You can change the background image of the access cards in the HTML file
- You can change the arrow icon of the access card with another icon from [the Fontawesome Library](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/)
