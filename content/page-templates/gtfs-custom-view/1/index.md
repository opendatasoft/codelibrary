This component cannot harness the capability of custom views to inherit the `ctx` contex from catalog filters, since download links cannot be fitlered by routes or stops. It simply provides a nice way to display a gtfs and shows how to use other datasets in a custom viewâ€”not only the one you are currently exploring.
