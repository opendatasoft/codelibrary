_This resource is intended to be used as custom view inside your catalog, where the dataset context is always named `ctx` and doesn't require any `ods-dataset-context` widget. Read the [user's guide section](https://help.opendatasoft.com/platform/en/publishing_data/07_configuring_visualizations/06_configuring_custom_view/custom.html#configuring-the-custom-view) about custom views for details_.

See this resource live [here](https://userclub.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/domaindatasets/custom/?sort=modified). (Note:
we made this page public for the sake of example, but it is most likely a private view).
