The only prerequisit is, like for a regular join, having a shared key between datasets to make the numerical aggregation match its geo shape.\nBig advantages are mainly to not overweight the statistical dataset by a processing join and storing multiple times the same geo shape in the data. and secondly to choose the geographical granularity or administrative level only when you render the map. A same statistical dataset can now be rendered with several geographical referentials as long as it contains all the needed keys, codes or names to match the geographical shapes.\nFor example: inhabitant dataset of a country can be rendered by region, departement, cities and so on as long as you have the geographical dataset of each administrative layers.\nHow it works: the technique is to aggregate the data with the ods-color-gradient to obtain the color gradient as a color object. Then feed an ods-map with this color object.\n","description":"This widget computes a gradient of colors based on a numerical aggregation.
