[{"content":"Save school officials time: give them a printable menu model containing up-to-date information\nDescription   The context\nFrench schools display their canteen menus each week either so that it can be read by students and their parents. In the majority of cases, the municipality sets the composition of the meals then sends the information to school establishments who then have to reprocess the information into a spreadsheet or a word processor in order to then print and display it.\nThe service\nTo help agents avoid repeating this task, Opendatasoft has created a model menu page that automatically generates the information from a dataset “school canteen menus”.\nThe ODS Advantage: the platform’s filters. They enable you to choose the elements to show on the menu. Data that is only useful to territorial agents do not need to be displayed on documents destined to the public.\nThe Use Case\nRennes Metropolis offers its schools a ready-to-print menu page for which the text is generated from a dataset updated by the General Canteen Service. Thanks to the platform’s filters, allergens and organic ingredients are highlighted with specific colors. The dataset includes the menus for the ongoing, past, and following weeks, allowing schools to anticipate the preparation of the menus displayed.\nRequirements    An Opendatasoft platform  Get the App   Get the code on Github\nSee it live here\nContact us to learn how we can accompany you in implementing this connection with the Waze API.\n","description":"Save school officials time: give them a printable menu model containing up-to-date information","objectID":"c252414e4f8c0e97b0e5550c13b3a52a","permalink":"https://codelibrary.opendatasoft.com/apps/canteen/","relpermalink":"/apps/canteen/","section":"Apps","tags":[],"title":"School Canteen Menu Displays"},{"content":"Create a live COVID-19 for your county, city etc. with local data.\nDescription   The context\nYou have a regularly updated source of data about COVID-19 for your region (e.g. County or City) that that reflects information not available nationwide.

To increase transparency around inspection data and thus enable the population to make an informed choice of where to go to eat, the DGAL has created the Alim\u0026rsquo;Confiance app.\nThe service\nAlim\u0026rsquo;Confiance is a mobile and desktop web app, connected to the Ministry of Agriculture’s data platform, operated by Opendatasoft. It is from there that the app retrieves daily results of new inspections. The app offers a cartographic visualization of all the inspected establishments and makes it possible to filter them by types (glacier, cheesemonger, collective catering, etc.) and by their level of hygiene (from \u0026ldquo;very satisfactory\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;needs urgent changes\u0026rdquo;). As the results need to be as legible and explicit as possible, a gradual system of smileys has been chosen.\nThe ODS Advantage: a poster to print by the restaurant’s owner. Each inspected establishment is indicated by a pin on the inspection map. By clicking on the marker, a tooltip appears and gives access to a small card that the restaurant owner can print, in the manner of \u0026ldquo;homemade\u0026rdquo; banners used by some restaurants on their menu.

The only prerequisit is, like for a regular join, having a shared key between datasets to make the numerical aggregation match its geo shape.\nBig advantages are mainly to not overweight the statistical dataset by a processing join and storing multiple times the same geo shape in the data. and secondly to choose the geographical granularity or administrative level only when you render the map. A same statistical dataset can now be rendered with several geographical referentials as long as it contains all the needed keys, codes or names to match the geographical shapes.\nFor example: inhabitant dataset of a country can be rendered by region, departement, cities and so on as long as you have the geographical dataset of each administrative layers.\nHow it works: the technique is to aggregate the data with the ods-color-gradient to obtain the color gradient as a color object.
